# Mid Bootcamp Project Linear Regression Modell

This project is a part of the [Data Analytics Bootcamp](https://www.ironhack.com/en/data-analytics/berlin#fulltime) at Ironhack. 


#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a Linea Regression Model, which predicts the housing prices of the King County in Washington State, USA. 
 

### Methods Used
* Descriptive Statistics
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* MySql
* Pandas, jupyter

## Project Description
The task was to build a machine learning model to predict the selling prices of houses based on a variety of features on which the value of the house is evaluated.
Further, I would explore the characteristics of the houses using some business intelligence tool. One of those parameters include understanding which factors are responsible for higher property value - $650K and above. The data was originally published [here](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction). 
The data visualization was done with Tableau. 


## Needs of this project
